description: Provides additional instructions for React Native Expo development, such as using TypeScript, StyleSheet for styling, and Expo's secure store for sensitive data. Enforces best practices for React Native Expo development within the src directory, promoting maintainable and efficient code.
globs: *.*
---
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper styling using StyleSheet
- Utilize Expo's vector icons
- Use Expo's secure store for sensitive data
- Implement proper offline support
- Follow React Native best practices for performance
- Use Expo's OTA updates for quick deployments

- Use functional components with hooks
- Utilize Expo SDK features and APIs
- Implement proper navigation using React Navigation
- Use Expo's asset system for images and fonts
- Implement proper error handling and crash reporting
- Utilize Expo's push notification system

- Ensure the following folder structure is present:
  - assets/
  - src/
    - components/
    - screens/
    - navigation/
    - hooks/
    - utils/
  - App.js
  - app.json


- Always keep App.js clean and delegate work to other components.
- Always configure app.json based on the documentation


- Babel configuration for NativeWind:
  - Include 'nativewind/babel' in the plugins array.
  - Avoid using jsxImportSource in presets.
  - Ensure 'react-native-reanimated/plugin' follows 'nativewind/babel'.


- Use PowerShell for terminal commands.
- Before installing a new package, check if it's already installed:
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter package-name
- If installed, upgrade using:
  expo upgrade <package-name>
  or
  npm install <package-name>
  if not supported by Expo.
- Use PowerShell commands to manage the project, e.g., moving and renaming files:
  Move-Item -Path .\old\path\file.txt -Destination .\new\path\newname.txt
- If unsure about the current structure or details, use PowerShell to list out necessary information:
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse
- Utilize official Expo libraries and upgrade them using Expo's commands.
- Avoid deleting existing functionality or files without a valid reason.
- Follow the recommended folder structure and maintain organized code for scalability and readability.
- Implement navigation using Expo Router for clean and declarative routing.


- NativeWind and Tailwind CSS compatibility:
  - Use nativewind@2.0.11 with tailwindcss@3.3.2.
  - Higher versions may cause 'process(css).then(cb)' errors.
  - If errors occur, remove both packages and reinstall specific versions:
    npm remove nativewind tailwindcss
    npm install nativewind@2.0.11 tailwindcss@3.3.2


- Use functional components with hooks.
- Leverage Expo SDK features and APIs.
- Implement navigation using Expo Router.
- Manage assets with Expo's asset system for images and fonts.
- Ensure robust error handling and crash reporting.
- Utilize Expo's push notification system.
- Adopt TypeScript for type safety.
- Apply consistent styling using StyleSheet.
- Incorporate Expo's vector icons.
- Secure sensitive data with Expo's SecureStore.
- Implement proper offline support.
- Optimize performance following React Native best practices.
- Deploy updates using Expo's OTA mechanism.
- Style components using NativeWind.
