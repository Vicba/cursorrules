# Setup New Feature

## Overview
Systematically set up a new feature from initial planning through to implementation structure.  

## Steps
1. **Define requirements**
   - Clarify feature scope and goals
   - Identify user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Plan technical approach and constraints

2. **Create feature branch**
   - Branch from main/develop with a descriptive name
   - Set up or update local development environment if needed
   - Configure any new dependencies or services

3. **Plan architecture**
   - Design data models and APIs
   - Plan UI components, flows, and states
   - Consider testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)

4. **Scaffold implementation**
   - Create initial modules, components, and routes
   - Add placeholder tests and fixtures
   - Wire up basic data flow end‑to‑end (happy path)
